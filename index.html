<!-- 
we import the below links from typing react cdn on the browser -->
<!-- the below lines need to above the react code always...if they are after the react code the compiler does not know about react so it throws error -->
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
<!-- there are two things above that are imported
react and react dom
react is basically a library that provides us features
react dom is glue between our react and dom...it glues react with dom
both of them are separate because react native(it is for mobile applications) does not require react dom so that people for app applications do not require react dom and they can use react only -->
<!-- CDN links are not preferred as if react versions are updaqted we will have to change our cdn links continuously...thus we use react packages from npm react from browser
However even better is create react app -->
