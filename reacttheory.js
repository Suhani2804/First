//the document contains react and a little bit of jsx theory
// in terminal write:
// the following three commands
// npx create-react-app my-app
// the above line is to create a folder my-app for react

// cd my-app
// npm start

//the above two lines are to open react from my-app folder

//react is a library and since react is a library we can write it in html to render things
//react is a library as we can use it in different parts of code
//react is written inside the script tag in html just like js.

//better to prepare a different js file for react

//create react tab helps us to create following things: 
//react uses webpack bundler
//react uses node modules and node modules contain all the packages and dependencies which are required by react
//node modules are basically dependencies of reacts
//public folder has images,logo and maifest.json that has meta data
//src folder has normal ffiles that we want to run
//gitignore are files that we dont want to push to git
//package.json{} has information of all dependencies that we are using ...looking at this helps us understand everything we are using in our project as everything has an entry there
//anything is node package files are mentioned in the package.json{} file
//any files that can be regenerated after a command are not pushed to git

//bundlers make our project fast by making it more efficient through minification of code
//WEBPACK---->installed automatically and is a bundler
//parcel====>bundler installed by us
//JSX-------->React element(JS OBJECT)------>browser understands
//BABEL---->  converts jsx code to a code which browser understands---->knows as transpiler

//root is a dom element
//react-dom is used to connect with html pages
//props- they are properties that we pss to the react components
//config driven -ui tells us how we want to display our webite by using API
